# BlockPuzzle
Input is 2d-Array (its row and its column are equal) ..Ex 2x2 Or 3x3 2d-Array.
Task is taking bigger colored square from array for Example

That is marked with green is output because of defining Square colored element in array.
That is marked with red is wrong because of defining colored element actually in array but Not Square 
The user input size of array and define colored element and rest of them keep as uncolored 
And In codeing we convert colored into 1s and uncolored into 0s
#### we solve it with 2 Algorithms and we compute time complexity and we implement the best.
##### First in Task.java (thebest)
        O(N*N)

##### Second in Imp2.java
        O(N^4)
