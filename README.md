# BlockPuzzle
Input is 2d-Array (its row and its column are equal) ..Ex 2x2 Or 3x3 2d-Array.
Task is taking bigger colored square from array for Example 3X3
|1 1 1|
|0 1 1|
|1 1 1|

The output is 2X2 Square colored array
That is 3x2 is wrong because of defining colored element actually in array but Not Square 
The user input size of array and define colored element and rest of them keep as uncolored 
And In codeing we convert colored into 1s and uncolored into 0s
#### we solve it with 2 Algorithms and we compute time complexity and we implement the best.
##### First in Task.java (thebest)
        O(N*N)

##### Second in Imp2.java
        O(N^4)
